<h1><b>Visual Novel Project - Untitled<br></h1>
<h2>Tentative Deadline: January 2017<br>
First Functional Build & First Scene by: December 1st, 2016<br>
Spec Sheet<br>
</h2>
<br>
Look, feel, & aura of the game:<br></b>
This is a casual romance game. The dialogue will not take itself too seriously so that the product doesn’t look amateur. The story will be left completely unfinished, thus, plot points and developments will not be a critical factor of the creation of this demo. UI, sound, and art should have a very modern, reserved, casual, inviting, and warm aura. All design choices should add to the user’s experience. Functionality should not be overwhelmingly complicated, or dense for the sake of being difficult. The UI should have only the active elements that are immediately needed at any given point in time. The music should be interesting, engaging, but not intrusive on the user’s experience when the story/dialogue doesn’t call for it. Pay special attention to details that add to the user experience without them realizing it.<br>
