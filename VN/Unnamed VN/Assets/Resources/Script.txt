P "Well, can’t say it’s not at least partly my fault. Enrolling in Computer Science without even owning a computer... Who does that?"

Using the two techniques we discussed in class, iterative and recursive, write a method PrintStrings that will iterate through an array of at least five strings and print them to the console."
