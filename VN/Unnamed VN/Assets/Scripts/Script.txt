P "*deep sigh* Geez, that took forever. Classes like that should come with a warning when you register: “Class Time: 1 hour. Real-Feel: 2 weeks.”"
P "Well, can’t say it’s not at least partly my fault. Enrolling in Computer Science without even owning a computer... Who does that?"
P "I guess I should get to doing my homework. It was so dark when I left yesterday that I nearly missed the last bus so I better get started. Let’s see what we got here..."
Computer "Assignment #3 We now know how to create an array of strings, traverse through the array, and print the strings to the console. Using the two techniques we discussed in class, iterative and recursive, write a method PrintStrings that will iterate through an array of at least five strings and print them to the console."
P "... iter-what?..."
P "Okay... so according to my HelloWorld assignment, Console.Println() should write something to the console..."
"You type in ‘Console.println(something)’ and nothing appears in the console"
P "Error? What went wrong this time?"
"You struggle throughout the evening to complete your assignment"
P "Agh! Why isn’t it compiling?! Shoot, it’s already starting to get dark. I guess I’ll finish up the rest tomorrow."
"Beautiful orange and red hues seem to stain every corner of your surroundings as the sun sinks into the horizon."
"But you’re too exhausted to care. For you, the sun setting means the end of another long day of work."
P "*deep sigh* This isn’t working out for me. Maybe I should get a job and save up for a computer."

? "Oh, I know! I’ll put a keylogger on here and set this webcam to record his reaction at the same time tomorrow."
? "I’m a genius. By tomorrow, I’ll have full access to his account and get to see the look on his face when he sees all his files renamed."
? "Someone that stupid... I’m not sure if even my comments will be of any help."

Classmate2 "Eager to go somewhere?"
Classmate1 "I don’t have anything in mind, but since it’s Friday, we should do something."
Classmate2 "Sounds good to me. You coming?"
P "What?"
Classmate1 "Come on, let’s go!"
Classmate2 "Yeah, we can hit up the bar or something. There’s bound to be some girls around there."
P "Girls, huh?.."
Classmate1 "Come on, are you a college student or not? Let’s get drunk on a Friday while we’re still underage."
P "... I wish I could, but I can’t exactly BECAUSE it’s a Friday. "
Classmate1 "What? "
P "The professors give more homework on weekends and I don’t have a PC at home... "
Classmate2 "Aww, can’t you just come back here and do it tomorrow?"
P "I’m already stretching my budget really thin... I can’t afford the bus tickets to come here tomorrow..."
Classmate1 "Oh man, that’s rough. Sorry to hear that... "
Classmate2 "Yeah... Sorry, we didn’t know."
P "Oh, it’s all good, guys. It just sucks I can’t go with you guys."
Classmate1 "Don’t worry about it. We can hang out another time, for sure. Hey, if you need anything we’re always around, okay? "
Classmate2 "Yeah, give us a call when you’re free or if you need to talk or anything."
P "Sure. Thanks a lot, guys. See you next week. "
Classmate1 "Yeah, take care!"
