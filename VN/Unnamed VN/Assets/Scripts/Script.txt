P "Well, can’t say it’s not at least partly my fault. Enrolling in Computer Science without even owning a computer... Who does that?"
P "I guess I should get to doing my homework. It was so dark when I left yesterday that I nearly missed the last bus so I better get started. Let’s see what we got here..."
"Text on monitor" "Assignment #3 We now know how to create an array of strings, traverse through the array, and print the strings to the console. Using the two techniques we discussed in class, iterative and recursive, write a method PrintStrings that will iterate through an array of at least five strings and print them to the console."
P "… iter-what?..."
P "Okay... so according to my HelloWorld assignment, Console.Println() should write something to the console…"
"You type in ‘Console.println(something)’ and nothing appears in the console"
P "Error? What went wrong this time?"
"You struggle throughout the evening to complete your assignment"
P "Agh! Why isn’t it compiling?! Shoot, it’s already starting to get dark. I guess I’ll finish up the rest tomorrow."
"Beautiful orange and red hues seem to stain every corner of your surroundings as the sun sinks into the horizon."
"But you’re too exhausted to care. For you, the sun setting means the end of another long day of work."
P "-Deep sigh- This isn’t working out for me. Maybe I should get a job and save up for a computer."
